Process for Implementing PHPMailer
Install PHPMailer Library:

Using Composer: Run composer require phpmailer/phpmailer to install PHPMailer.
Manual Installation: Download the library from PHPMailer's GitHub page and place it in your project folder.
Include Required Files:

Make sure to include all necessary files or classes, such as PHPMailer, SMTP, and Exception.
Retrieve Form Data:

Collect the required data from the form, such as name, email, subject, and message, and store them in variables.
Create a PHPMailer Instance:

Create an instance of the PHPMailer class. Passing true as an argument enables exceptions, which helps in debugging.
Configure SMTP Server Settings:

Set the SMTP server details:
Provide the SMTP mail server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).
Set the SMTP username and password (use an app password generated by Gmail, not your regular password).
Set Recipient Details:

Specify the recipient's email address and name.
Send the Email:

Use the send() method to send the email and handle any errors.
